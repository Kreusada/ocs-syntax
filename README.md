  OceanScript Esoteric Language VSCode Extension Plugin
  <br>
</h1>

This is the repository for the oceanscript plugin, used for VSCode.
The current implementation only includes syntax highlighting at this
time, but I'm hopeful to release intellisense and even linting at
some point.

This is also currently unavailable on the VSCode marketplace as it's still 
being constructed. For early access, clone this repo under `%userprofile%\.vscode\extensions`
with a suitable name i.e. "ocs".
